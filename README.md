### I'm a Full Stack developer and here in my github you'll find repos that showcase my path during Holberton School, in the [low-level](https://github.com/Sainterman/holbertonschool-low_level_programming) theres a lot of problems solved using C, in [higher level](https://github.com/Sainterman/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming) I studied Python and it's OOP aproach aswell as some JavaScript, in the [DevOps](https://github.com/Sainterman/holberton-system_engineering-devops) repo I created some usefull scripts using Bash, set up a remote server trough ssh and config with some Puppet files. The [AirBnb clone](https://github.com/Sainterman/AirBnB_clone_v3) is built using Python with Flask framework; it's basically an API to acces a database of places.
