# Hello there traveler üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Welcome to my GitHub!
### I'm a Full Stack developer and here in my github you'll find repos that showcase my path during Holberton School, in the [low-level](https://github.com/Sainterman/holbertonschool-low_level_programming) theres a lot of problems solved using C, in [higher level](https://github.com/Sainterman/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming) I studied Python and it's OOP aproach aswell as some JavaScript, in the [DevOps](https://github.com/Sainterman/holberton-system_engineering-devops) repo I created some usefull scripts using Bash, set up a remote server trough ssh and config with some Puppet files. The [AirBnb clone](https://github.com/Sainterman/AirBnB_clone_v3) is built using Python with Flask framework; it's basically an API to acces a database of places.

### Besides holberton projects I've worked on small personal projects like the [todo_list-JS](https://github.com/Sainterman/todo_list-JS) a very simple and minimalistic TODO list, the [webpage-thumbnail-generator](https://github.com/Sainterman/webpage-thumbnail-generator) creates stmall thumbnails from screenshots using the [Screenshot API](https://screenshotapi.net); Golang is used to serve the frontend made with VueJs.

### One of the oldest repo is actually one of my favorite projects, [SpaceWars](https://github.com/Sainterman/spaceWars) which is a 2 player game for the windows cmd made in C++ where you drive a ship and have to destroy the other player, it's a bit old and I'm not sure it works today but the source code is there for anyone who wants to make a port.

## üí¨ Ask me about data structures such as linked lists and hash tables, microservices and web infrastructure. 
### I may not be an expert but I enjoy talking about that and learning more.
