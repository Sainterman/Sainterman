    <h1>Resume</h1>
	<h2>Santiago Castillo | Software developer</h1>
    <p> I'm a Self taught developer focused on web development. Currently based in Medellin, Colombia.
    I've been studying software since 2013 and started to code in C++ as part of my college studies, but eventually dropped out.</p>
    <p>During my studies I've approached video game development with Unity and JS;
         I worked for a short time in the industry but decided to follow a different path</p>
    <p>After toying with many languages and technologies I decided to focus my effort in becoming 
        a Full Stack web developer and enlisted in Holberton School's Software engineering program.</p>    
    <p>During this phase of my life I improved my data structures, algorithms, 
        back-end and front-end skills working on project oriented methodologies. Helping me become a more productive developer,
        I'm someone who can learn on his own but prefers to share and learn with friends and colleagues
    </p>
   
   <h2>Technologies I've used and love</h2>
   <h3>Linux</h3>
   <p>Theres no need for an introduction here, it's simply great</p>
   <h3>Python </h3>   
   <p> is probably my favorite language to code in, it feels natural to me and I'm comfortable using it.
       I developed an <a href="https://github.com/Sainterman/AirBnB_clone_v3">Airbnb backend</a> 
        like API using Flask and MySql, and studied it broadly as you can see 
        <a href="https://github.com/Sainterman/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming">in this repo</a>
   </p>
   <h3>C</h3>
   <p>This is one of the languages that has made me understand software better than any other. Managing memory and processes with
        it lets you see the apparent magic behind programming. I developed a <a href=""></a> mini shell</p>
    
    <h3>Vue, Go and DynamoDb</h3>
    <p>Although my experience is limited here, I worked with peers from Holberton to develop <a href="https://staging.thedeckapp.com/#/">The Deck App</a>, 
        I was involved in the creation of some front end elements and storage functionalities using DynamoDb written in Go.
    </p>
     <h4>Basics that every web dev should know:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JS</li>
    </ul>    


    <h1>More about me</h1>
        <p>Since I was very little computers have played a massive role in my life, my first interaction with one was on a Windows 95 machine, watching my older brother play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine_(video_game)">Quarantine</a> and 1989s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_(1989_video_game)">Prince of Persia <img src="" alt=""></a> and playing those games at a early age.</p>
        <p>As the years passed my love for video games increased and led me to play things like World Of Warcraft and many shooters that I still love and play.</p>
